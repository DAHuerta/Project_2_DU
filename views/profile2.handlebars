                <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and
                    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                    release of
                    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                    like
                    Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <p>Why do we use it?
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when
                    looking at
                    its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                    letters, as
                    opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                    publishing
                    packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
                    'lorem
                    ipsum'
                    will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
                    sometimes
                    by
                    accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
